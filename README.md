## Mobile-Responsive-Portfolio
## Description

Recognizing the diversity of screen sizes that come with today's phones, tablets, and computers, I was motivated to create a web application with a responsive layout, so that the website could be easily viewed regardless of the user's viewport. I used CSS properties such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables in order to execute this project. 

## Installation

The project required the following programming languages: HTML and CSS. In order to create a mobile friendly portfolio website, flexbox and media queries were applied. 

## Usage 

This project can be used by anyone looking to showcase their portfolio work, as well as to share their contact and biography information to potential employees, in a mobile-friendly format. 

The following screenshots show the web application's appearance and functionality in different browsers (mobile and computer):
